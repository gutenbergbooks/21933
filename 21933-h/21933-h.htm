      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      A belief that modern Christmas fiction is too cheerful in tone, too
      artistic in construction, and too original in motive, has inspired the
      author of this tale of middle-class life. He trusts that he has escaped,
      at least, the errors he deplores, and has set an example of a more
      seasonable and sensational style of narrative.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.&mdash;The Curse (Registered).
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHEN this story of my life, or of such parts of it as are not deemed
      wholly unfit for publication, is read (and, no doubt, a public which
      devoured &lsquo;Scrawled Black&rsquo; will stand almost anything), it will be found
      that I have sometimes acted without prim cautiousness&mdash;that I have,
      in fact, wallowed in crime. Stillicide and Mayhem I (rare old crimes!) are
      child&rsquo;s play to <i>me</i>, who have been an &lsquo;accessory after the fact!&rsquo; In
      excuse, I can but plead two things-the excellence of the opportunity to do
      so, and the weakness of the resistance which my victim offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you cannot allow for these, throw the book out of the railway-carriage
      window! You have paid your money, and to the verdict of your pale morality
      or absurd sense of art in fiction I am therefore absolutely indifferent.
      You are too angelic for me; I am too fiendish for you. Let us agree to
      differ. I say nothing about my boyhood. Twenty-five years ago a poor
      boy-but no matter. <i>I</i> was that boy! I hurry on to the soaring period
      of manhood, &lsquo;when the strength, the nerve, the intellect is or should be
      at its height,&rsquo; or <i>are</i> or should be at <i>their</i> height, if you
      <i>must</i> have grammar in a Christmas Annual. <i>My</i> nerve was at its
      height: I was thirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, what was I then? A miserable moonstruck mortal, duly entitled to
      write M.D. (of Tarrytown College, Alaska) after my name&mdash;for the
      title of Doctor is useful in the profession&mdash;but with no other source
      of enjoyment or emotional recreation in a cold, casual world. Often and
      often have I written M.D. after my name, till the glowing pleasure palled,
      and I have sunk back asking, &lsquo;Has life, then, no more than this to offer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bear with me if I write like this for ever so many pages; bear with me, it
      is such easy writing, and only thus can I hope to make you understand my
      subsequent and slightly peculiar conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      How rare was hers, the loveliness of the woman I lost&mdash;of her whose
      loss brought me down to the condition I attempt to depict!
    </p>
    <p>
      How strange was her rich beauty! She was at once dark and fair&mdash;<i>la
      blonde et la brune!</i> How different from the Spotted Girls and
      Two-headed Nightingales whom I have often seen exhibited, and drawing
      money too, as the types of physical imperfections! Warm Southern blood
      glowed darkly in one of Philippa&rsquo;s cheeks&mdash;the left; pale Teutonic
      grace smiled in the other&mdash;the right. Her mother was a fair blonde
      Englishwoman, but it was Old Calabar that gave her daughter those curls of
      sable wool, contrasting so exquisitely with her silken-golden tresses. Her
      English mother may have lent Philippa many exquisite graces, but it was
      from her father, a pure-blooded negro, that she inherited her classic
      outline of profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippa, in fact, was a natural arrangement in black and white. Viewed
      from one side she appeared the Venus of the Gold Coast, from the other she
      outshone the Hellenic Aphrodite. From any point of view she was an
      extraordinarily attractive addition to the Exhibition and Menagerie which
      at that time I was running in the Midland Counties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father, the nature of whose avocation I never thought it necessary to
      inquire into, was a sea cook on board a Peninsular and Oriental steamer.
      His profession thus prevented him from being a permanent resident in this,
      or indeed in any other country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first meeting was brought about in a most prosaic way. Her mother
      consulted me professionally about Philippa&rsquo;s prospects. We did not at that
      time come to terms. I thought I might conclude a more advantageous
      arrangement if Philippa&rsquo;s <i>heart</i> was touched, if she would be mine.
      But she did not love me. Moreover, she was ambitious; she knew, small
      blame to her, how unique she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fact is,&rsquo; she would observe when I pressed my suit, &lsquo;the fact is I
      look higher than a mere showman, even if he can write M.D. after his
      name.&rsquo; Philippa soon left the circuit &lsquo;to better herself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time a telegram from her apprised me that she was an orphan. I
      flew to where she lodged, in a quiet, respectable street, near Ratcliff
      Highway. She expressed her intention of staying here for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But alone, Philippa?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      (She was but eight-and-thirty).
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not so much alone as you suppose,&rsquo; she replied archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This should have warned me, but again I passionately urged my plea. I
      offered most attractive inducements. A line to herself in the bills!
      Everything found!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Basil,&rsquo; she observed, blushing in her usual partial manner, &lsquo;you are a
      day after the fair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there are plenty of fairs,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;all of which we attend
      regularly. What can you mean? Has another&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He hev,&rsquo; said Philippa, demurely but decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are engaged?&rsquo; She raised her lovely hand, and was showing me a gold
      wedding circlet, when the door opened, and a strikingly handsome man of
      some forty summers entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something written in his face (a dark contusion, in fact, under
      the left eye) which told me that he could not be a pure and high-souled
      Christian gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Basil South, M.D.&rsquo; said Philippa, introducing us. &lsquo;Mr. Baby Farmer&rsquo; 
      (obviously a name of endearment), and again a rosy blush crept round her
      neck in the usual partial manner, which made one of her most peculiar
      charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed mechanically, and, amid a few dishevelled remarks on the weather,
      left the house the most disappointed showman in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cur, sneak, coward, villain!&rsquo; I hissed when I felt sure I was well out of
      hearing. &lsquo;Farewell, farewell, Philippa!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To drown remembrance and regret, I remained in town, striving in a course
      of what moralists call &lsquo;gaiety&rsquo; to forget what I had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many try the same prescription, and seem rather to like it! I often
      met my fellow-patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, on the steps of the Aquarium, I saw the man whom I suspected of
      not being Philippa&rsquo;s husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is that cove?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Him with the gardenia?&rsquo; replied a friend, idiomatically. &lsquo;That is Sir
      Runan Errand, the amateur showman&mdash;him that runs the Live Mermaid,
      the Missing Link, and Koot Hoomi, the Mahatma of the Mountain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What kind of man is he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just about the usual kind of man you see generally here. Just about as
      hot as they make them. Mad about having a show of his own; crazed on
      two-headed calves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he married?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If every lady who calls herself Lady Errand had a legal title to do so,
      the &ldquo;Baronetage&rdquo; would have to be extended to several supplementary
      volumes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was Philippa&rsquo;s husband!
    </p>
    <p>
      What was she among so many?
    </p>
    <p>
      My impulse was to demand an explanation from the baronet, but for reasons
      not wholly unconnected with my height and fighting weight, I abstained.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did better. I went to my hotel, called for the hotel book, and
      registered an oath, which is, therefore, copyright. I swore that in
      twenty-five years I would be even with him I hated. I prayed, rather
      inconsistently, that honour and happiness might be the lot of her I had
      lost. After that I felt better.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;A Villain&rsquo;s By-Blow.
    </h2>
    <p>
      PHILIPPA was another&rsquo;s! Life was no longer worth living. Hope was
      evaluated; ambition was blunted. The interest which I had hitherto felt in
      my profession vanished. All the spring, the elasticity seemed taken out of
      my two Bounding Brothers from the Gutta Percha coast. For months I did my
      work in a perfunctory manner. I added a Tattooed Man to my exhibition and
      a Two-headed Snake, also a White-eyed Botocudo, who played the guitar, and
      a pair of Siamese Twins, who were fired out of a double-barrelled cannon,
      and then did the lofty trapeze business. They drew, but success gave me no
      pleasure. So long as I made money enough for my daily needs (and whisky
      was cheap), what recked I? My mood was none of the sweetest. My friends
      fell off from me; ay, they fell like nine-pins whenever I could get within
      reach of them. I was alone in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will not be surprised to hear it; the wretched have no friends. So
      things went on for a year. I became worse instead of better. My gloom
      deepened, my liver grew more and more confirmed in its morbid inaction.
      These are not lover&rsquo;s rhapsodies, they merely show the state of my body
      and mind, and explain what purists may condemn. In this condition I heard
      without hypocritical regret that a distant relative (a long-lost uncle)
      had conveniently left me his vast property. I cared only because it
      enabled me to withdraw from the profession. I disposed of my exhibition,
      or rather I let it go for a song. I simply handed over the Tattooed Man,
      the Artillery Twins, and the Double-headed Serpent to the first-comer, who
      happened to be a rural dean. Far in the deeps of the country, near the
      little town of Roding, on a lonely highway, where no man ever came, I took
      a &lsquo;pike. Here I dwelt like a hermit, refusing to give change to the rare
      passers-by in carts and gigs, and attended by a handy fellow, William
      Evans, stolid as the Sphynx, which word, for reasons that may or may not
      appear later in this narrative, I prefer to spell with a <i>y</i>,
      contrary to the best authorities and usual custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was midwinter, and midnight. My room lay in darkness. Heavy snow was
      falling. I went to the window and flattened my nose against the pane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What,&rsquo; I asked myself, &lsquo;is most like a cat looking out of a window?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A cat looking in at a window,&rsquo; answered a silvery voice from the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flattened against the self-same pane was another nose, a woman&rsquo;s. It was
      the lovely organ of mixed architecture belonging to Philippa! With a low
      cry of amazement, I broke the pane: it was no idle vision, no case of the
      &lsquo;horrors;&rsquo; the cold, cold nose of my Philippa encountered my own. The ice
      was now broken; she swept into my chamber, lovelier than ever in her
      strange unearthly beauty, and a new sealskin coat. Then she seated herself
      with careless grace, tilting back her chair, and resting her feet on the
      chimney-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Philippa,&rsquo; I exclaimed politely, &lsquo;how is your husband?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Husband! I have none,&rsquo; she hissed. &lsquo;Tell me, Basil, did you ever hate a
      fellow no end?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I answered, truly; for, like Mr. Carlyle, I just detested most
      people, and him who had robbed me of Philippa most of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know what he did, Basil? <i>He insisted on having a latch-key!</i>
      Did you ever hate a man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I threw out my arms. My heart was full of bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He did more! He has refused to pay my last quarter&rsquo;s salary. Basil,
      didn&rsquo;t you ever hate a man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My brain reeled at these repeated outrages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where are you staying at present, Philippa? I hope you are pretty
      comfortable?&rsquo; I inquired, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippa went on: &lsquo;My husband as was has chucked me. I was about to have a
      baby. I bored him. I was in the way&mdash;in the family-way. Basil, did
      you ever hate a fellow? If not, read this letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw a letter towards me. She chucked it with all her old gracious
      dexterity. It was dated from Monte Carlo, and ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As we don&rsquo;t seem quite to hit it off, I think I may as well finish this
      business of our marriage. The shortest way to make things clear to your
      very limited intelligence is to assure you that you are not my wife at
      all. Before I married you I was the husband of the Live Mermaid. She has
      died since then, and I might have married you over and over again; but I
      was not quite so infatuated. I shall just run across and settle up about
      this little affair on Wednesday. As you are five miles from the station,
      as the weather is perfectly awful, as moreover I am a luxurious,
      self-indulgent baronet and as this story would never get on unless I
      walked, don&rsquo;t send to meet me. I would <i>rather</i> walk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a pretty letter from a fond husband. &lsquo;But, ha! proud noble,&rsquo; I
      whispered to my heart, &lsquo;you and me shall meet to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where are you staying, Philippa?&rsquo; I repeated, to lead the
      conversation into a more agreeable channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With a Mrs. Thompson,&rsquo; she replied; &lsquo;a lady connected with Sir Runan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, let me call for your things tomorrow. I can pass myself off as
      your brother, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My half-brother,&rsquo; said Philippa, blushing, &lsquo;on the mother&rsquo;s side.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The brave girl thought of <i>everything</i>. The child of white parents, I
      should have in vain pretended to be Philippa&rsquo;s full brother. They would
      not have believed me had I sworn it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rsquo; Philippa continued, as a sudden thought occurred to
      her, &lsquo;that as it is almost midnight and snowing heavily it would be more
      proper for me to return to Mrs. Thompson&rsquo;s?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no contesting this.
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked together to the house of that lady, and at my suggestion
      Philippa sought her couch. I sat down and awaited the advent of Mrs.
      Thompson. She soon appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman of about five-and-thirty, with an aquiline face, and a long, dark,
      silky beard sweeping down to her waist. Whatever this woman&rsquo;s charms might
      have been for me when I was still in the profession, she could now boast
      of very few. Doubtless she had been in Sir Runan&rsquo;s show, and was one of
      his victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      I apologised for the lateness of my call, and entered at once on business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thompson remarked that &lsquo;my sister&rsquo;s health was not as it should be,&rsquo;&mdash;not
      all she could wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not wish to alarm you; no doubt you, her brother, are <i>used</i> to
      it; but, for a girl as mad as a hatter&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll trouble you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I myself can write M.D. after my name,&rsquo; I replied,&rsquo; and you are related,
      I think, to Sir Runan Errand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are connections,&rsquo; she said, not taking the point of my sarcasm. &lsquo;His
      conduct rarely astonishes me. When I found, however, that this lady, your
      sister, was his wife, I own, for once, I <i>was</i> surprised.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling that this woman had the better of it, with her calm, polished,
      highbred sarcasms, I walked back to the &lsquo;pike, full of hopes of a sweet
      revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      As, however, I had never spoken to a baronet before, I could not but fear
      that his lofty air of superior rank might daunt me when we met to-morrow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.&mdash;Mes Gages! Mes Gages!
    </h2>
    <p>
      NEXT morning came, chill and grey, and reminded me that I had two duties.
      I was to wait at home till Philippa came over from Mrs. Thompson&rsquo;s, and I
      was also to hang about the road from the station, and challenge Sir Runan
      to mortal combat. Can duties clash? They can. They did! The hours lagged
      slowly by, while I read Sir Runan&rsquo;s letter, read and re-read it,
      registered and re-registered (a pretty term of my own invention) this vow
      of vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippa&rsquo;s &lsquo;things &lsquo;&mdash;her boxes with all her properties&mdash;arrived
      in due time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippa did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed a distracted day, now bounding forth half way to the railway
      station to meet Sir Runan, now speeding back at the top of my pace to
      welcome Philippa at the &lsquo;pike.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I knew not by what train Sir Runan would reach Roding, nor when
      Philippa might be looked for, I thus obtained exercise enough to make up
      for months of inaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the last train was due.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now pitch-dark and snowing heavily, the very time which Philippa
      generally chose for a quiet evening walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rushed half-way to Roding, changed my mind, headed back, and arrived at
      the &lsquo;pike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has a lady called for me?&rsquo; I asked the Sphynx.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, is it likely, sir?&rsquo; answered my fellow, with rough humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I must go and meet her,&rsquo; I cried, and, hastily snatching a
      bull&rsquo;s-eye lantern and policeman&rsquo;s rattle from the Sphynx, I plunged into
      the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      First I hurried to Mrs. Thompson&rsquo;s, where I learned that Philippa had just
      gone out for a stroll after a somewhat prolonged luncheon. This was like
      Philippa. I recognised that shrinking modesty which always made her prefer
      to veil her charms by walking about after nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning from Mrs. Thompson&rsquo;s, I felt the snow more sharply on my face.
      Furiously, blindly, madly it whirled here and drifted there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should I go for Sir Runan? Should I wait where I was? Should I whistle for
      a cab? Should I return to the &lsquo;pike?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly out of the snow came a peal of silvery laughter. Philippa waltzed
      gracefully by in a long ulster whitened with snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I detected her solely by means of my dark lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rushed on her, I seized her. I said, &lsquo;Philippa, come back with me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, all the fun&rsquo;s in the front,&rsquo; shrieked Philippa. &lsquo;My quarter&rsquo;s salary!
      Oh, my last quarter&rsquo;s salary!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these wild words, like bullets from a Gatling gun rattling in my
      ears, I seized Philippa&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something fell, and would have rattled on the hard high road had it not
      been for the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stooped to pick up this shining object, and with one more wild yell of
      &lsquo;My quarter&rsquo;s salary!&rsquo; Philippa waltzed again into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fatigued with the somewhat exhausting and unusual character of the day&rsquo;s
      performances, and out of training as I was, I could not follow her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically, I still groped on the ground, and picked up a small chill
      object.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a latch-key! I thrust it in my pocket with my other keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a thought occurred to me, and I chucked it over the hedge, to serve
      as circumstantial evidence. Next I turned and went up the road, springing
      my rattle and flashing my bull&rsquo;s-eye lantern on every side, like Mr.
      Pickwick when he alarmed the scientific gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, with a cry of horror, I stopped short. At my very feet, in the
      little circle of concentrated light thrown by the lantern, lay a white
      crushed, cylindrical mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      That mass I had seen before in the warm summer weather&mdash;that mass,
      once a white hat, had adorned the brows of that masher!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sir Runan&rsquo;s topper!
    </p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;As A Hatter!
    </h2>
    <p>
      YES, the white hat, lying there all battered and crushed on the white
      snow, must be the hat of Sir Runan! Who else but the tigerish aristocrat
      that disdained the homely four-wheeler and preferred to walk five miles to
      his victim on this night of dread&mdash;who else would wear the gay
      gossamer of July in stormy December?
    </p>
    <p>
      In that hat, thanks doubtless to its airy <i>insouciant</i> grace, he had
      won Philippa; in that hat he would have bearded her, defied her, and cast
      her off! The cruelty of man! The larger and bulkier crumpled heap which
      lay on the road a little beyond the hat, that heap with all its outlines
      already blurred by snow, that heap must be the baronet himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, but this was vengeance, swift, deadly vengeance!
    </p>
    <p>
      But how, but how had she wreaked it? <i>She</i>, already my heart
      whispered <i>she!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Was my peerless Philippa then a murderess?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, say not so; call hers (ye would do so an she had been an Irish felon)
      &lsquo;the wild justice of revenge,&rsquo; or the speedy execution of the outraged
      creditor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Killed by Philippa!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, and why? The answer was only too obvious. She must have gone forth to
      meet him, and to wring from him, by what means she might, that quarter&rsquo;s
      salary which the dastard had left unpaid. Then my thoughts flew to the
      door-key, the cause of that fierce family hatred which burned between
      Philippa and her betrayer. That latch-key she had wrested from him, it had
      fallen from her hand, and I&mdash;I had pitched it into space!
    </p>
    <p>
      Overcome with emotion, I staggered in the direction of the &lsquo;pike. All the
      way, in the blinding, whirling snow, I traced the unobliterated prints of
      a small fairy foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a dreary comfort! Philippa had gone before me; the prints of the
      one small foot were hers. She must, then, have hopped all the way! Could
      such a mode of progression be consistent with a feeling of guilt? Could
      remorse step so gaily?
    </p>
    <p>
      My man William, the Sphynx, opened the door to me. Assuming a natural air,
      I observed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss South is at home?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir. Just come in, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is she now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir, she just is on the rampage. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make &lsquo;is fur fly,&rdquo; she up
      and sez, sez she, when she heard as you was hout. Not a nice young lady
      for a small tea-party, sir,&rsquo; he added, lowering his voice; &lsquo;a regular
      out-and-outer your sister is, to be sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sphynx, in spite of his stolidity, occasionally ventured upon some
      slight liberty when addressing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made a gay rejoinder, reflecting on the character of his own unmarried
      female relations, and entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippa was sitting on the lofty, dark oak chimney-piece, with her feet
      dangling unconventionally over the fireplace. The snow, melting from her
      little boots and her hair, had made a large puddle on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came up and stood waiting for her to speak, but she kept pettishly
      swinging her small feet, as one who, by the action, means to signify
      displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Philippa,&rsquo; I said sternly, &lsquo;speak to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, here&rsquo;s a gay old flare-up!&rsquo; cried Philippa, leaping from the
      chimney-piece, and folding her arms fiercely akimbo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are you? Where&rsquo;s the baby? <i>You</i> a brother; you&rsquo;re a pretty
      brother! Is <i>this</i> the way you keep &lsquo;pointments with a poor girl? Who
      killed the baby? You did&mdash;you <i>all</i> did it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her words ran one into the other, as with an eloquence, which I cannot
      hope to reproduce (and indeed my excellent publisher would not permit it
      for a moment), she continued to dance derisively at me, and to heap
      reproaches of the most vexatious and frivolous nature on my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Philippa,&rsquo; I remarked at last, &lsquo;you frivol too much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A sullen look settled on her face, and, with the aid of a chair, she
      reseated herself in her former listless, drooping attitude upon the
      chimney-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      On beholding these symptoms, on hearing these reproaches, a great wave of
      joy swept over my heart. Manifestly, Philippa was indeed, as Mrs. Thompson
      had said, &lsquo;as mad as a hatter.&rsquo; Whatever she might have done did not
      count, and was all right. We would plead insanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had fallen a victim to a mental disease, the source of which I have no
      hesitation in saying has not yet been properly investigated. So far as I
      know there is no monograph on the subject, or certainly I would have read
      it up carefully for the purpose of this Christmas Annual. I cannot get on
      without a mad woman in my stories, and if I can&rsquo;t find a proper case in
      the medical books, why, I invent one, or take it from the French. This one
      I have invented.
    </p>
    <p>
      The details of Philippa&rsquo;s case, though of vast and momentous professional
      interest, I shall reserve for a communication to some journal of Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the treatment, I measured out no less than sixty drops of laudanum,
      with an equal amount of very old brandy, in a separate vessel. But
      preparing a dose and getting a patient like this to take it, are two
      different things. I succeeded by the following device.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sent for some hot water and sugar and a lemon. I mixed the boiling
      element carefully with the brandy, and (separately) with the laudanum.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a little of the <i>former</i> beverage. Philippa with unaffected
      interest beheld me repeat this action again and again. A softer, more
      contented look stole over her beautiful face. I seized the moment. Once
      more I pressed the potion (the <i>other</i> potion) upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Softly murmuring &lsquo;More sugar,&rsquo; Philippa sank into a sleep&mdash;sound as
      the sleep of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippa might awaken, I hoped, with her memory free from the events of
      the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Princess Toto, in the weird old Elizabethan tragedy, quite forgot the
      circumstance of her Marriage, so Philippa might entirely forget her
      Murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we remember what women are, the latter instance of obliviousness
      appears the more probable.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.&mdash;The White Groom.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I SHALL, I am sure, scarcely be credited when I say that Philippa&rsquo;s
      unconsciousness lasted for sixteen days. I had wished her to sleep so long
      that the memory of her deeds on the awful night should fade from her
      memory. She seemed likely to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the time she slept I felt more and more secure, because the snow never
      ceased falling. It must have been thirty feet deep above all that was
      mortal of Sir Runan Errand. The deeper the better. The baronet was never
      missed by any one, curious to say. No inquiries were made; and this might
      have puzzled a person less unacquainted than myself with the manners of
      baronets and their friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes an awful fascination led me along the road where I had found the
      broken, battered mass. I fancied I could see the very drift where the
      thing lay, and a dreary temptation (dating probably from the old times
      when I had some wild beasts in the exhibition) urged me to &lsquo;stir it up
      with a long pole.&rsquo; I resisted it, and, bitterly weeping, I turned away
      towards Philippa&rsquo;s bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I walked I met Mrs. Thompson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does she hate him?&rsquo; she asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forgiveness is a Christian virtue,&rsquo; I answered evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not trust this woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and try to understand. If I thought she hated him, I
      would tell her something. If she thought you hated them, he would tell me
      something. If ye or you thought he hated her, I would tell him something.
      I will wait and see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She left me to make the best (which was not much) of her enigmatical
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was evidently a strange woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt that she was mixed up in Sir Runan&rsquo;s early life, and that we were
      mixed up in Sir Runan&rsquo;s early death&mdash;in fact, that everything was
      very mixed indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came back. &lsquo;Give me your name and college,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;not necessarily
      for publication,&rsquo; and I divined that she had once been a proctor at
      Girton. I gave her my address at the public-house round the corner, and we
      parted, Mrs. Thompson whispering that she &lsquo;would write.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching home I leaped to Philippa&rsquo;s apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great change had come over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was awake!
    </p>
    <p>
      I became at once a prey to the wildest anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulties of my position for the first time revealed themselves to
      me. If Philippa remained insane, how was I to remove her from the scene of
      her&mdash;alas! of her crime? If Philippa had become sane, her position
      under my roof was extremely compromising. Again, if she were insane, a
      jury might acquit her, when the snow melted and revealed all that was left
      of the baronet. But, in that case, what pleasure or profit could I derive
      from the society of an insane Philippa? Supposing, on the other hand, she
      was sane, then was I not an &lsquo;accessory after the fact,&rsquo; and liable to all
      the pains and penalties of such a crime?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the final question arose and shook its ghostly finger at me: &lsquo;Can a
      sane man be an accessory after the fact in a murder committed by an insane
      woman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as I know, there is no monograph on this subject, or certainly I
      would have consulted it for the purpose of this Christmas Annual.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these questions swept like lightning through my brain, as I knelt by
      Philippa&rsquo;s bedside, and awaited her first word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Bon jour</i>, Philippine,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Basil,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;where am I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Under my roof&mdash;your brother&rsquo;s roof,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brother! oh, stow that bosh!&rsquo; she said, turning languidly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      There could not be a doubt of it, Philippa was herself again!
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose pensively, and wandered out towards the stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Covered with white snow over a white macintosh, I met by the coach-house
      door William, the Sphynx.
    </p>
    <p>
      The White Groom!
    </p>
    <p>
      Twiddling a small object, <i>a door-key of peculiar make</i>, in his hand,
      he grinned stolidly at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a rum un, squire, your sister, she be,&rsquo; chuckled the Sphynx.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;William,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;go to Roding, and bring back two nurses, even if they
      have to hire twenty drags to draw them here. And, William, bring some
      drugs in the drags.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By setting him on this expedition I got rid of the Sphynx. Was he a
      witness? <i>He was certainly acquainted with the nature of an oath!</i>

    <p>
      OF course when I woke next morning my first thought was of Philippa; my
      second was of the weather. Always interesting, meteorological observation
      becomes peculiarly absorbing when it entirely depends on the thermometer
      whether you shall, or shall not, be arrested as an accessory after the
      fact, or (as lawyers say) <i>post-mortem</i>. My heart sank into my boots,
      or rather (for I had not yet dressed) into my slippers, when I found that,
      for the first time during sixteen days, the snow had ceased falling. I
      threw up the sash, the cold air cut me like a knife. Mechanically I threw
      up the sponge; it struck hard against the ceiling, and fell back a mass of
      brittle, jingling icicles, so severe was the iron frost that had bound it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gathered up a handful of snow from the window-sill. It crumbled in my
      fingers like patent camphorated tooth-powder, for which purpose I
      instantly proceeded to use it. Necessity is the mother of invention. Then
      I turned, as a final test, to my bath. Oh, joy! it was frozen ten inches
      thick! No tub for me today! I ran downstairs gleefully, and glanced at the
      thermometer outside my study window. Hooray, it registered twenty degrees
      below zero! It registered! That reminded me of my oath! I registered it
      once more, regardless of legal expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      My spirits rose as rapidly as the glass had fallen. The wind was due east,
      not generally a matter for indecent exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while the wind was due east, so long the frost would last, and that
      white mass on the roadside would remain <i>in statu quo</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So long, Philippa was safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that her fate, and mine too, depended on the eccentricities of a
      jury, the chartered libertinism of an ermined judge, the humour of the
      law, on a series of points without precedent concerning which no monograph
      had as yet been written; and, as a last desperate resource, on the letters
      of a sympathetic British public in the penny papers. The penny papers, the
      criminal&rsquo;s latest broadsheet anchor! Under the exasperating circumstances,
      Philippa remained as well as could be expected. She spoke little, but ate
      and drank a good deal. Day after day the brave black frost lasted, and the
      snowy grave hid all that it would have been highly inconvenient for me to
      have discovered. The heavens themselves seemed to be shielding us and
      working for us. Do the heavens generally shield accessories after the
      fact, and ladies who have shortened the careers of their lords? These
      questions I leave to the casuist, the meteorologist, the compilers of
      weather forecasts, and other constituted authorities on matters connected
      with theology and the state of the barometer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not given the year in which these unobtrusive events occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many who can remember that mighty fall of snow, exceeding aught in the
      recollection of the oldest inhabitant, and the time during which the frost
      kept it on the earth, will be able and willing to fix the date.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not object to their thus occupying their leisure with chronological
      research.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they feel at all baffled by the difficulties of the problem, I will
      give them an additional &lsquo;light&rsquo;: <i>Since that year there has been no
      weather like it</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Answers may be sent to the Puzzle Editor of <i>Truth</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day by day Philippa grew better and better. This appears to be the usual
      result, of excessively seasonable weather acting on a constitution
      previously undermined by bigamy, murder, and similar excesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spare all technical summary of the case, sufficient to say that this was
      one of the rare instances in which the mind, totally unhinged, is restored
      to its balance by sixty drops of laudanum taken fasting, with a squeeze of
      lemon, after violent exercise on an empty stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case is almost unique; but, had things fallen out otherwise, this
      story could never have been got ready in time to romp in before the other
      Christmas Annuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters would have become really <i>too</i> complicated!
    </p>
    <p>
      As Philippa recovered, it became more and more evident even to the most
      dilatory mind that the sooner she left the scene of her late unrehearsed
      performance the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baronet had not yet been missed&mdash;indeed, he never <i>was</i>
      missed, and that is one of the very most remarkable points in the whole
      affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he <i>did</i> come to be missed, however, he would naturally be
      sought for in the neighbourhood of the most recent and attractive of his
      wives.
    </p>
    <p>
      That wife was Philippa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything pointed to instant flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how was I to get Philippa to see this? <i>Ex hypothesi</i> she knew
      nothing of the murder. On the other hand, all her pure, though passionate
      nature would revolt against sharing my home longer than was necessary. But
      would not the same purity prevent her from accompanying me abroad?
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother and sister we had called ourselves but Philippa had never been the
      dupe of this terminology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, was not her position, in any case, just a little shady?
    </p>
    <p>
      An idea now occurred to me for the first time. Many men would long ere now
      have asked their mothers to <i>chaperon</i> them. It flashed across me
      that I had a mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      He who says &lsquo;mother&rsquo; says &lsquo;chaperon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I would take my Philippa to my mother. Philippa was now completely
      convalescent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can only attribute my lingering to the sense of fatality that all things
      would come round and be all square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love I had laid aside till I could see my way a little clearer in the
      certainly perplexing combination of circumstances. Nevertheless, Philippa,
      I say it advisedly, seemed to me a good deal more pure and innocent than
      when we first met. True, she had been secretly married to a man under a
      name which she knew to be false.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, she had given birth to a baby whose later fate remains a mystery
      even to this day. True, her hands were stained with the blood of Sir Runan
      Errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why speak of Redistribution, why agitate for Woman&rsquo;s Suffrage, if
      trifles like these are to obstruct a girl&rsquo;s path in society?
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippa&rsquo;s wrongs had goaded her to madness. Her madness was responsible
      for the act. She was not mad any longer. Therefore she was not
      responsible. Therefore Philippa was innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she became mad again, then it would be time to speak of guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But would these arguments be as powerful with a British as they certainly
      would have proved with a French jury?
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Philippa seemed to awaken to a sense of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once she asked me &lsquo;How she came to my home that night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You came <i>out of</i> the whirling snow, and <i>in</i> a high state of
      delirium,&rsquo; I answered, epigrammatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought I came on foot,&rsquo; she replied, dreamily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Basil,&rsquo; she went on, &lsquo;what afterwards? What&rsquo;s the next move, my
      noble sportsman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What, indeed! Philippa had me there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly it was time to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to avert suspicion, I thought it was better not to shut up my
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the same purpose, I did a little in crime on my own account.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man tires of only being an accessory.
    </p>
    <p>
      William, the Sphynx, obviously &lsquo;was in the know,&rsquo; as sporting characters
      say. Was in the know of what was in the snow! I must silence William.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took my measures quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      First I laid in two dozen of very curious pale sherry at half-a-crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bought each bottle at a separate shop in a different disguise (making
      twenty-four in all), that my proceedings might not attract attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laid down the deadly fluid with all proper caution in the cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      At parting from William I gave him five shillings and the cellar key,
      telling him to be very careful, and await my instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew well that long before my &lsquo;instructions&rsquo; could reach him, the
      faithful William would be speechless, and far beyond the reach of human
      science.
    </p>
    <p>
      His secret would sleep with the White Groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Philippa and I drove to town, Philippa asking me conundrums, like
      Nebuchadnezzar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was something I dreamed of. Tell me what it was?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, though better informed than the Wise Men and Soothsayers of old, I
      did not gratify her unusual desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching town I drove straight to the hotel at which my mother was
      staying.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of those highly-priced private hotels in the New Out.
    </p>
    <p>
      As, however, I had no desire to purchase this place of entertainment, the
      exorbitant value set on it by its proprietors did not affect my spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes I had told my mother all save two things: the business of
      the baby, and the fate which had overtaken Sir Runan.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these trifling exceptions she knew all.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fall into Philippa&rsquo;s arms was, to my still active parent, the work of a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Philippa looked at me with an artless wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Basil, my brother, you are really too good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, how happy I should have felt could that one dark night&rsquo;s work have
      been undone!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;Rescue And Retire!
    </h2>
    <p>
      HITHERTO I have said little about my mother, and I may even seem to have
      regarded that lady in the light of a temporary convenience. My readers
      will, however, already have guessed that <i>my</i> mother was no common
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider for a moment the position which she so readily consented to
      occupy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trifling details about the sudden decease of Sir Runan and the affair
      of the baby, as we have seen, I had thought it better <i>not</i> to name
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters, therefore, in her opinion, stood thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippa was the victim of a baronet&rsquo;s wiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      When off with the new love, she had promptly returned and passed a
      considerable time under the roof of the old love; that is, of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I had suddenly arrived with this eligible prospective daughter-in-law
      at my mother&rsquo;s high-priced hotel, and I kept insisting that we should at
      once migrate, we three, to foreign parts&mdash;the more foreign the
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had especially dilated on the charms of the scenery and the salubrity of
      the climate in <i>countries where there was no extradition treaty with
      England</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if there was nothing in these circumstances to arouse the watchful
      jealousy of a mother, it must be remembered that, as a <i>chaperon</i>,
      she did seem to come a little late in the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you have lived together so long without me,&rsquo; some parents would have
      observed, &lsquo;you can do without me altogether.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      None of these trivial objections occurred to my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was good-nature itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just returned from a professional tour on the Continent (she was, I should
      have said, in the profession herself, and admirably filled the <i>exigeant</i>
      part of Stout Lady in a highly respectable exhibition), my mother at once
      began to pack up her properties and make ready to accompany us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was there a more good-humoured <i>chaperon</i>. If one of us entered
      the room where she was sitting with the other, she would humorously give
      me a push, and observing &lsquo;Two is company, young people, three is none,&rsquo; 
      would toddle off with all the alacrity that her figure and age permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I learned from inquiries addressed to the <i>Family Herald</i>
      (correspondence column) that the Soudan was then, even as it is now, the
      land safest against English law. Spain, in this respect, was reckoned a
      bad second.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very next day I again broached the subject of foreign travel to my
      mother. It was already obvious that the frost would not last for ever.
      Once the snow melted, once the crushed mass that had been a baronet was
      discovered, circumstantial evidence would point to Philippa. True, there
      was no one save myself who could positively <i>swear</i> that Philippa had
      killed Sir Runan. Again, though I could positively swear it, my knowledge
      was only an inference of my own. Philippa herself had completely forgotten
      the circumstance. But the suspicions of the Bearded Woman and of the White
      Groom were sure to be aroused, and the Soudan I resolved to seek without
      an hour&rsquo;s delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reckoned without my hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother at first demurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You certainly don&rsquo;t look well, Basil. But why the Soudan?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A whim, a sick man&rsquo;s fancy. Perhaps because it is not so very remote from
      Old Calabar, the country of Philippa&rsquo;s own father. Mother, tell me, how do
      you like her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is the woman you love, and however shady her antecedents, however
      peculiar her style of conversation, she is, she must be, blameless. To say
      more, after so short an acquaintance, might savour of haste and
      exaggeration.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman&rsquo;s logic!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you <i>will</i> come to the Soudan with us to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, my child, further south than Spain I will <i>not</i> go, not this
      journey!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Philippa entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the next news, old man?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Spain, to-morrow!&rsquo; 
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;Rain, rain, Go to Spain,
     Be sure you don&rsquo;t come back again.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      sang sweet Philippa, in childish high spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had rarely seen her thus!
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, Philippa&rsquo;s nursery charm against the rain proved worse than
      unavailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon, after several months of brave black frost, which had
      gripped the land in its stern clasp, the rain began to fall heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white veil of snow gradually withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that night I dreamed of the white snow slowly vanishing from the white
      hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning the snow had vanished, and the white hat must have been
      obvious to the wayfaring man though a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, and the next, and the next, found me still in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>My mother was shopping!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the awful torture of having a gay mother shopping the solemn hours
      away, when each instant drew her son nearer to the doom of an accessory
      after the fact!
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother did not object to travel, but she <i>did</i> like to have her
      little comforts about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She occupied herself in purchasing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A water-bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>boule</i>, or hot-water bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A portable stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      A travelling kitchen-range.
    </p>
    <p>
      A medicine chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      A complete set of Ollendorff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten thousand pots of Dundee marmalade. And such other articles as she
      deemed essential to her comfort and safety during the expedition. In vain
      I urged that our motto was <i>Rescue and Retire</i>, and that such
      elaborate preparations might prevent our retiring from our native shore,
      and therefore make rescue exceedingly problematical.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Tory mother only answered by quoting the example of Lord Wolseley and
      the Nile Expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long did <i>they</i> tarry among the pots&mdash;the marmalade pots?&rsquo; 
      said my mother. &lsquo;Did <i>they</i> start before every mess had its proper
      share of extra teaspoons in case of accident, and a double supply of
      patent respirators for the drummer-boys, and of snow-shoes for the
      Canadian boatmen in case the climate proved uncertain?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother&rsquo;s historical knowledge, and the unique example of provident and
      exhaustive equipment which she cited, reduced me to silence, but did not
      diminish my anxiety. The delay made me nervous, excited, and chippy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-morrow morning we were to start.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-morrow morning was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an effort I opened the morning paper&mdash;the <i>Morning Post</i>,
      as it happened&mdash;and ran hastily up and down the columns, active
      exercise having been recommended to me. What cared I for politics, foreign
      news, or even the sportive intelligence? All I sought for was a paragraph
      headed &lsquo;Horrible Disclosures,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;Awful Death of a Baronet.&rsquo; I ran up
      and down the columns in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      No such item of news met my eye. Joyously I rose to go, when my eye fell
      on the Standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically I opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those words were written (or so they seemed to me to be written) in
      letters of fire, though the admirable press at Shoe Lane did not really
      employ that suitable medium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Horrible Discovery near Roding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At once the truth flashed across me. The <i>Morning Post</i> had not
      contained the intelligence because,
    </p>
    <p>
      The Government had Boycotted the &lsquo;Morning Post&rsquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Only journals which more or less supported the Government were permitted
      to obtain &lsquo;copy&rsquo; of such thrilling interest!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet they speak of a free press and a free country!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tearing myself away from these reflections, I bent my mind on the awful
      paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The melting of the snow has thrown a lurid light on the mysterious
      disappearance (which up to this moment had attracted no attention) of an
      eccentric baronet, well known in sporting circles. Yesterday afternoon a
      gentleman&rsquo;s groom, wading down the highway, discovered the white hat of a
      gentleman floating on the muddy stream into which the unparalleled weather
      and the negligence of the Road Trustees has converted our thoroughfare. An
      inscription in red ink within the lining leaves no doubt that this article
      of dress is all that is left of the late Sir Runan Errand. The unfortunate
      nobleman&rsquo;s friends have been communicated with. The active and intelligent
      representative of the local police believes that he is in possession of a
      clue to the author of the crime. Probably the body of the murdered noble
      has been carried down by the flooded road to the sea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I tore that paper to pieces, and used it to wrap up sandwiches for the
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again I say, if you cannot feel with me, throw this tale aside.
      Heaven knows it is a sombre one, and it goes on getting sombrer and
      sombrer! But probably, by this time, you have either tossed the work away
      or looked at the end to see what happened to them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning dawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      I filled my bag with Hanover pieces, which I thought might come in handy
      on the Spanish Turf, and packed up three or four yellow, red, green, and
      blue opera hats, so useful to the adventurous bookmaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this very moment the postman arrived and gave me a letter in a woman&rsquo;s
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thrust it in my breast pocket recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cab rattled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last we were off.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sure that no one who could have seen us that morning would have
      dreamt that out of that party of three&mdash;a more than
      comfortable-looking English matron, a girl whose strange beauty has been
      sufficiently dwelt upon, and a gentleman in a yellow crush hat and a
      bookmaker&rsquo;s bag&mdash;two were flying from the hands of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our appearance was certainly such as to disarm all suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But appearances are proverbially deceitful. Were ours deceitful enough?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But where are we going?&rsquo; said my mother, with the short memory of old
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Paris first, then to Spain, and, if needful, down to Khartoum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Then</i> you young people will have to go alone. I draw the line at
      Dongola.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I glanced at Philippa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then for the first time since her malady I saw Philippa blushing! Her long
      curved eyelashes hid her eyes, which presumably were also pink, but
      certainly my mother&rsquo;s broad pleasantry had called a tell-tale blush to the
      cheek of the young person.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we drew near Folkestone I remembered the letter, but the sight of the
      Roding postmark induced me to defer opening it till we should be on board
      the steamer. When Philippa was battling with the agonies of the voyage,
      then, undisturbed, I might ascertain what Mrs. Thompson (for it was sure
      to be Mrs. Thompson) had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were now on board. Philippa and my mother fled to the depths of the
      saloon, and I opened the fateful missive. It began without any
      conventional formalities, and the very first words blanched a cheek
      already pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see yer!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This strange epistle commenced:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>I</i> know why Sir Runan never reached my house. I know the reason (it
      was only too obvious) for <i>her</i> strange, excited state. I know how he
      met the death he deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never had the pluck. None of the rest of us ever had the pluck. We all
      swore we&rsquo;d swing for him as, one after another, he wedded and deserted us.
      The Two-headed Nightingale swore it, and the Missing Link, and the Spotted
      Girl, and the Strong Woman who used to double up horseshoes. Now she
      doubles up her perambulator with her children in it, but she never doubled
      up him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As to your sister, tell her from me that she is all right. She has made
      herself his widow, she is the Dowager Lady Errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fact is, <i>the Live Mermaid was never alive at all!</i> She was a
      put-up thing of waxwork and a stuffed <i>salmo ferox</i>. His pretended
      marriage with <i>her</i> is therefore a mere specious excuse to enable him
      to avoid your sister&rsquo;s claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now he is dead, your sister can take the name, title, and estates. I wish
      she may get them.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;Local Colour.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I READ the woman&rsquo;s letter again and again, read it with feelings of the
      most mingled description. First, I reflected with solemn pride that
      Philippa was <i>more</i> than an honest woman; that she really was a
      baronet&rsquo;s lady! After we were married she should keep her title. Many
      people do. How well it would sound when we entered a room together&mdash;&rsquo; 
      Dr. South and Lady Errand!&rsquo; Yet, on second thoughts, would not this
      conjunction of names rather set people asking questions?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, disagreeable associations might be revived.
    </p>
    <p>
      My second thought was that, if Mrs. Thompson kept her word, we might as
      well go home at once, without bothering about the Soudan. The White Groom,
      I felt certain, had long been speechless. There was thus no one to connect
      Lady Errand with the decease of Sir Runan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, Philippa&rsquo;s self-respect was now assured. She had lost it when
      she learned that she was not Sir Runan&rsquo;s wife; she would regain it when
      she became aware that she had made herself Sir Runan&rsquo;s widow. Such is the
      character of feminine morality, as I understand the workings of woman&rsquo;s
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had reached this point in my soliloquy, when I reflected that perhaps I
      had better <i>not</i> tell Philippa anything about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, things were so very mixed, because Philippa&rsquo;s memory was so
      curiously constructed that she had entirely forgotten the murder which she
      had committed; and even if I proved to her by documentary evidence that
      she had only murdered her own husband, it might not help to relieve her
      burdened conscience as much as I had hoped. There are times when I almost
      give up this story in despair. To introduce a heroine who is mad in and
      out, so to speak, and forgets and remembers things exactly at the right
      moment, seems a delightfully simple artifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, upon my word, I am constantly forgetting what it is that Philippa
      should remember, and on the point of making her remember the very things
      she forgets!
    </p>
    <p>
      So puzzled had I become that I consoled myself by cursing Sir Runan&rsquo;s
      memory. <i>De mortuis nil nisi bonum!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      What a lot of trouble a single little murder, of which one thinks little
      enough at the time, often gives a fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while we were approaching Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stains of travel washed away, my mother gave a sigh of satisfaction as
      she seated herself at the dinner table. As any one might guess who looked
      at her, she was no despiser of the good things of this life! That very
      night we went to the Hippodrome, where we met many old acquaintances. My
      own Artillery Twins were there, and kissed their hands to me as they flew
      gracefully over our heads towards the desired trapeze. Here, also, was the
      Tattooed Man, and I grasped his variegated and decorative hand with an
      emotion I have rarely felt. Without vanity I may say that Philippa and my
      mother had a <i>succès fou</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment when they entered their box every <i>lorgnette</i> was
      fixed upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Paris was there, the <i>tout Paris</i> of <i>premières</i>, of <i>les
      courses</i>, the <i>tout Paris</i> of <i>clubsman</i> of <i>belles petites</i>,
      of ladies <i>à chignon jaune</i>. Here were the Booksmen, the <i>gommeux</i>,
      they who <i>font courir</i>, the journalists, and here I observed with
      peculiar interest my great masters, M. Fortuné du Boisgobey and M. Xavier
      de Montépin.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the intervals of the performance <i>tout le monde</i> crowded into our
      <i>loge</i>, and I observed that my mother and Lady Errand made an almost
      equal impression on many a gallant and enterprising young <i>impresario</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We supped at the <i>Cafe Bignon</i>; toasts were carried; I also was
      carried home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning I partly understood the mental condition of Philippa. I had
      absolutely forgotten the events of the later part of the entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several bills arrived for windows, which, it seems, I had broken in a
      moment of effusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gendarmes arrived, and would have arrested me on a charge of having
      knocked down some thirty-seven of their number.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little matter was easily arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      I apologised separately and severally to each of the thirty-seven <i>braves
      hommes</i>, and collectively to the whole corps, the French army, the
      President, the Republic, and the statue of Strasbourg in the Place de la
      Concorde. These duties over, I was at leisure to reflect on the injustice
      of English law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain actions which I had entirely forgotten I expiated at the cost of a
      few thousand francs, and some dozen apologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      For only one action, about which she remembered nothing at all, Philippa
      had to fly from English justice, and give up her title and place in
      society! Both ladies now charmed me with a narrative of the compliments
      that had been paid them; both absolutely declined to leave Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to look at the shops,&rsquo; said my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want the <i>gommeux</i> to look at me,&rsquo; said Philippa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of them saw the least fun in my proposed expedition to Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weeks passed and found us still in the capital of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      My large fortune, except a few insignificant thousands, had passed away in
      the fleeting exhilaration of baccarat.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must do something to restore our wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother had an idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Basil,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you speak of Spain. You long to steep yourself in
      local colour. You sigh for <i>hidalgos, sombreros, carbonados, and
      carboncillos</i>, why not combine business with pleasure?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not take the Alhambra?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This <i>was</i> an idea!
    </p>
    <p>
      Where could we be safer than under the old Moorish flag?
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippa readily fell in with my mother&rsquo;s proposal. When woman has once
      tasted of public admiration, when once she has stepped on the boards, she
      retires without enthusiasm, even at the age of forty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had thought,&rsquo; said Philippa, of exhibiting myself at the Social Science
      Congress, and lecturing on self-advertisement and the ethical decline of
      the Moral Show business, with some remarks on waxworks. But the Alhambra
      sounds ever so much more toney.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was decided on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I threw away the Baedeker and Murray, and Ford&rsquo;s &lsquo;Spain,&rsquo; on which I had
      been relying for three chapters of padding and local colour. I ceased to
      think of the very old churches of St. Croix and St. Seurin and a variety
      of other interesting objects. I did not bother about St. Sebastian, and
      the Valley of the Giralda, and Burgos, the capital of the old Castilian
      kingdom, and the absorbing glories of the departed Moore. Gladly, gaily, I
      completed the necessary negotiations, and found myself, with Philippa, my
      mother, and many of my old <i>troupe</i>, in the dear old Alhambra, safe
      under the shelter of the gay old Moorish flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shake off black gloom, Basil South, and make things skip.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have conquered Fate!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;Saved! Saved!
    </h2>
    <p>
      GLORIOUS, wonderful Alhambra! Magical Cuadrado de Leicestero! Philippa and
      I were as happy as children, and the house was full every night.
    </p>
    <p>
      We called everything by Spanish names, and played perpetually at being
      Spaniards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>foyer</i> we named a <i>patio</i>&mdash;a space fragrant with the
      perfume of oranges, which the public were always sucking, and perilous
      with peel. Add to this a refreshment-room, <i>refectorio</i>, full of the
      rarest old <i>cigarros</i>, and redolent of <i>aqua de soda and
      aguardiente</i>. Here the <i>botellas</i> of <i>aqua de soda</i> were
      continually popping, and the <i>corchos</i> flying with a murmur of merry
      voices and of mingling waters. Here half through the night you could
      listen to&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The delight of happy laughter,
     The delight of low replies.
</pre>
    <p>
      With such surroundings, almost those of a sybarite, who can blame me for
      being lulled into security, and telling myself that my troubles were
      nearly at an end? Who can wonder at the <i>cháteaux en Espagne</i> that I
      built as I lounged in the <i>patio</i>, and assisted my customers to
      consume the <i>media aqua de soda</i>, or &lsquo;split soda,&rsquo; of the country?
      Sometimes we roamed as far as the Alcazar; sometimes we wandered to the
      Oxford, or laughed light-heartedly in the stalls of the <i>Alegria</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was our life. So in calm and peace (for we had secured a Tory <i>chuckerouto</i>
      from Birmingham) passed the even tenor of out days.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to marrying Philippa, it had always been my <i>intention</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether she was or was not Lady Errand; whether she had or had not
      precipitated the hour of her own widowhood, made no kind of difference to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment of ill-judged haste had been all her crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      That moment had passed. Philippa was not that moment. I was not marrying
      that moment, but Philippa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picture, then, your Basil naming and insisting on the day, yet somehow the
      day had not yet arrived. It did, however, arrive at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulty now arose under which name was Philippa to be married?
    </p>
    <p>
      To tell you the truth, I cannot remember under which name Philippa <i>was</i>
      married. It was a difficult point. If she wedded me under her maiden name,
      and if Mrs. Thompson&rsquo;s letter contained the truth, then would the wedding
      be legal and binding?
    </p>
    <p>
      If she married me under the name of Lady Errand, and if Mrs. Thompson&rsquo;s
      letter was false, then would the wedding be all square?
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as I know, there is no monograph on the subject, or there was none
      at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be it as it may, wedded we were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morality was now restored to the show business, the legitimate drama began
      to look up, and the hopes of the Social Science Congress were fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But evil days were at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, Philippa and I were lounging in the <i>patio</i>, when I heard
      the young <i>hidalgos</i>&mdash;or <i>Macheros</i>, as they are called&mdash;talking
      as they smoked their princely <i>cigaritos</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir Runan Errand,&rsquo; said one of them; &lsquo;where he&rsquo;s gone under. A rare bad
      lot he was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Murdered,&rsquo; replied the other. &lsquo;Nothing ever found of him but his hat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a rum go!&rsquo; replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Philippa. She had heard all. I saw her dark brow contract in
      anguish. She was beating her breast furiously&mdash;her habit in moments
      of agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I seem to remember that I and the two <i>hidalgos</i> bore Philippa
      to a couch in the <i>patio</i>, while I smiled and smiled and talked of
      the heat of the weather!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Philippa came back to herself, she looked at me with her wondrous
      eyes and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Basil; tell me the square truth, honest Injun! What had I been up to that
      night?&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.&mdash;Not Too Mad, But Just Mad Enough.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IT was out! She knew!
    </h3>
    <p>
      What was I to say, how evade her impulsive cross-examinations. I fell back
      upon evasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do I want to know?&rsquo; she echoed, &lsquo;because I choose to! I hated him. He
      took a walk, I took a walk, and I had taken something before I took a
      walk. If we met, I was bound to have words with him. Basil, did I dream
      it, or read it long ago in some old penny dreadful of the past?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippa occasionally broke into blank verse like this, but not often.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dearest, it must have been a dream,&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, catching at this hope of soothing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; she screamed; &lsquo;no&mdash;no dream. Not any more, thank you! I can
      see myself standing now over that crushed white mass! Basil, I could never
      bear him in that hat, and I must have gone for him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I consoled Philippa as well as I could, but she kept screaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>How</i> did I kill him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goodness only knows, Philippa,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;but you had a key in your
      hand&mdash;a door-key.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, that fatal latch-key!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;the cause of our final quarrel.
      Where is it? What have you done with it?&rsquo; she shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I threw it away,&rsquo; I replied. This was true, but I could not think of
      anything better to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You threw it away! Didn&rsquo;t you know it would become a <i>pièce
      justificatif?</i>&rsquo; said my poor Philippa, who had not read Gaboriau to no
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed the night wrestling in argument with Philippa. She reproached me
      for having returned from Spain, &lsquo;which was quite safe, you know&mdash;it
      is the place city men go to when they bust up,&rsquo; she remarked in her
      peculiarly idiomatic style. She reproved me for not having told her all
      about it before, in which case she would never have consented to return to
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They will try me&mdash;they will hang me!&rsquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;I can prove that you were quite out of your
      senses when you did for him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>You</i> prove it!&rsquo; she sneered; &lsquo;a pretty lawyer <i>you</i> are. Why,
      they won&rsquo;t take a husband&rsquo;s evidence for or against a wife in a criminal
      case. This comes of your insisting on marrying me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I doubt if we <i>are</i> married, Philippa, dear, as we never could
      remember whether you were wedded under your maiden name or as Philippa
      Errand. Besides&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; I was going to say that William, the White
      Groom (late the Sphynx), could show to her having been (as he once
      expressed it) as &lsquo;crazy as a loon,&rsquo; but I remembered in time. William had,
      doubtless, long been speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sherry must have done its fatal work.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the worst of committing crimes. They do nothing, very often, but
      complicate matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I not got rid of William&mdash;but it was too late for remorse. As to
      the evidence of her nurses, I forgot all about <i>that</i>. I tried to
      console Philippa on another line.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remarked that, if she had &lsquo;gone for&rsquo; Sir Runan, she had only served him
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I tried to restore her self-respect by quoting the bearded woman&rsquo;s
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pointed out that she had been Lady Errand, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gave Philippa no comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It makes things worse,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I thought I had only got rid of my
      betrayer; and now you say I have killed my husband. You men have no tact.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; Philippa went on, after pausing to reflect, &lsquo;I have not
      bettered myself one bit. If I had not gone for him I would be Lady Errand,
      and no end of a swell, and now I&rsquo;m only plain Mrs. Basil South.&rsquo; Speaking
      thus, Philippa wept afresh, and refused to be comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her remarks were not flattering to my self-esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time I felt, with peculiar bitterness, the blanks in Philippa&rsquo;s
      memory. Nothing is more difficult than to make your heroine not too mad,
      but just mad enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Philippa been a trifle saner, or less under the influence of luncheon,
      at first, she would either never have murdered Sir Runan at all (which
      perhaps would have been the best course), or she would have known <i>how</i>
      she murdered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire absence of information on this head added much to my
      perplexities.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, had Philippa been a trifle madder, or <i>more</i> under
      the influence of luncheon, nothing could ever have recalled the event to
      her memory at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it is, my poor wife (if she <i>was</i> my wife, a subject on which I
      intend to submit a monograph to a legal contemporary), my poor wife was
      almost provoking in what she forgot and what she remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day as my dear patient was creeping about the <i>patio</i>, she asked
      me if I saw <i>all</i> the papers?
    </p>
    <p>
      I said I saw most of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, look at them <i>all</i>, for who knows how many may be boycotted by
      the present Government? In a boycotted print you don&rsquo;t know but you may
      miss an account of how some fellow was hanged for what I did. I believe
      two people can&rsquo;t be executed for the same crime. Now, if any one swings
      for Sir Runan, <i>I</i> am safe; but it might happen, and you never know
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Philippa, ever thoughtful for others! I promised to read every one of
      the papers, and I was soon rewarded for the unparalleled tedium of these
      studies.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;A Terrible Temptation.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I HATE looking back and reading words which I have written when the
      printer&rsquo;s devil was waiting for copy in the hall, but I fancy I have
      somewhere called this tale a confession; if not, I meant to do so. It has
      no more claim to be called a work of art than the cheapest penny dreadful.
      How could it?
    </p>
    <p>
      It holds but two characters, a man and a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the rest are the merest supers. Perhaps you may wonder that I thus
      anticipate criticism; but review-writing is so easy that I may just as
      well fill up with this as with any other kind of padding.
    </p>
    <p>
      My publisher insists on so many pages of copy. When he does not get what
      he wants, the language rich and powerful enough to serve his needs has yet
      to be invented.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he struggles on with the help of a dictionary of American expletives.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, we are coming to the conclusion, and that, I think, will waken
      the public up! And yet this chapter will be a short one. It will be the
      review of a struggle against a temptation to commit, not perhaps crime,
      but an act of the grossest bad taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      To that temptation I succumbed; we both succumbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a temptation to which I dare think poor human nature has rarely been
      subjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temptation to go and see a man, a fellow-creature, tried for a crime
      which one&rsquo;s wife committed, and to which one is an accessory after the
      fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, that morning!
    </p>
    <p>
      How well I remember it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast was just oyer, the table with its relics of fragrant bloaters
      and <i>terrine</i> of <i>paté</i> still stood in the <i>patio</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was alone. I loafed lazily and at my ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I lighted a princely <i>havanna</i>, blaming myself for profaning the
      scented air from <i>el Cuadro de Leicester</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see I have such a sensitive aesthetic conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I took from my pocket the <i>Sporting Times</i>, and set listlessly
      to work to skim its lengthy columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was owing to my vow to Philippa, that I would read every journal
      published in England. As the day went on, I often sat with them up to my
      shoulders, and littering all the <i>patio</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran down the topics of the day. This scene is an &lsquo;under-study,&rsquo; by the
      way, of the other scene in which I read of the discovery of Sir Runan&rsquo;s
      hat. At last I turned my attention to the provincial news column. A name,
      a familiar name, caught my eye; the name of one who, I had fondly fancied,
      had: long-lain unburied in my cellar at the &lsquo;pike. My princely <i>havanna</i>
      fell unheeded on the marble pavement of the <i>patio</i>, as with
      indescribable amazement I read the following &lsquo;par.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;William Evans, the man accused of the murder of Sir Runan Errand, will be
      tried at the Newnham Assizes on the 20th. The case, which excites
      considerable interest among the <i>élite</i> of Boding and district, will
      come on the <i>tapis</i> the first day of the meeting. The evidence will
      be of a purely circumstantial kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Every word of that &lsquo;par&rsquo; was a staggerer. I sat as one stunned, dazed,
      stupid, motionless, with my eye on the sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was ever man in such a situation before?
    </p>
    <p>
      Your wife commits a murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      You become an accessory after the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      You take steps to destroy one of the two people who suspect the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then you find that the man on whom you committed murder is accused of
      the murder which you and your wife committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of my mother&rsquo;s voice scolding Philippa wakened me from my
      stupor. They were coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not face them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubling up the newspaper, I thrust it into my pocket, and sped swiftly
      out of the <i>patio</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where did I go? I scarcely remember. I think it must have been to one of
      the public gardens or public-houses, I am not certain which. All sense of
      locality left me. I found at last some lonely spot, and there I threw
      myself on the ground, dug my finger-nails into the dry ground, and held on
      with all the tenacity of despair. In the wild whirl of my brain I feared
      that I might be thrown off into infinite space. This sensation passed off.
      At first I thought I had gone mad. Then I felt pretty certain that it must
      be the other people who had gone mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had killed William Evans.
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife had killed Runan Errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, then, could Runan Errand have been killed by William Evans?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which is absurd,&rsquo; I found myself saying, in the language of Eukleides,
      the grand old Greek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Human justice! What is justice? See how it can err! Was there ever such a
      boundless, unlimited blunder in the whole annals of penny fiction?
      Probably not. I remember nothing like it in all the learned pages of the
      <i>London Journal</i> and the <i>Family Herald</i>. Mrs. Henry Wood and
      Miss Braddon never dreamed of aught like this. Philippa <i>must</i> be
      told. It was too good a joke. Would she laugh? Would she be alarmed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Picture me lying on the ground, with the intelligence fresh in my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt confidence, on the whole, in Philippa&rsquo;s sense of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then rose the temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trust this man (William Evans, late the Sphynx) to the vaunted array of
      justice!
    </p>
    <p>
      Let him have a run for his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go down and see the fun!
    </p>
    <p>
      Why hesitate? You cannot possibly be implicated in the deed. You will
      enjoy a position nearly unique in human history. You will see the man, of
      whose murder you thought you were guilty, tried for the offence which you
      know was committed by your wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every sin is not easy. My sense of honour arose against this temptation. I
      struggled, but I was mastered. I <i>would</i> go and see the trial. Home I
      went and broached the subject to Philippa. The brave girl never blenched.
      She had no hesitations, no scruples to conquer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Basil,&rsquo; she exclaimed, with sparkling eyes, &lsquo;wot larx! When do we
      start?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will admit that I did myself no injustice when, at the
      commencement of this tale, I said I had wallowed in crime.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.&mdash;Judge Juggins.
    </h2>
    <p>
      WE got down to Newnham, where the &lsquo;Sizes were held, on the morning of
      September 20th. There we discovered that we had an hour or two for
      refreshment, and I may say that both Philippa and I employed that time to
      the best advantage. While at the hotel I tried to obtain the file of the
      <i>Times</i>. I wanted to look back and see if I could find the account of
      the magisterial proceedings against the truly unlucky William Evans.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, should I call him unlucky? He had escaped the snare I had laid
      for him, and perhaps (such things have been) even a Newnham jury might
      find him not guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the file of the <i>Times</i> was not forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked the sleepy-eyed Teutonic waiter for it. He merely answered, with
      the fatuous patronising grin of the German <i>kellner</i>:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You vant?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want the file of the Times!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have the corkscrew of the good landlord; but the file of the <i>Times</i>
      I have it not. Have you your boots, your fish-sauce, your currycomb?&rsquo; he
      went on. Then, lapsing into irrelevant local gossip, &lsquo;the granddaughter of
      the blacksmith has the landing-net of the bad tailor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want my bill, my note, my <i>addition</i>, my <i>consommation</i>,&rsquo; I
      answered angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good bed, very good post-horse,&rsquo; he replied at random, and I left
      the County Hotel without being able to find out why suspicion had fallen
      on &ldquo;William Evans&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hailed one of the cabs which stood outside the hotel door, when a heavy
      hand was laid on my shoulder, and a voice, strange but not unfamiliar,
      exclaimed, &lsquo;Dr. South, as I am a baronet&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned round suddenly and found myself face to face with
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Runan Errand!
    </p>
    <p>
      My brain once more began to reel. Here were the real victim and the true
      perpetrators of a murder come to view the trial of the man who was charged
      with having committed it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I was trembling like an aspen leaf? I remembered that we lived in
      an age of &lsquo;telepathy&rsquo; and psychical research.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Runan was doubtless what Messrs. Myers and Gurney call a <i>visible
      apparition</i> as distinguished from the common <i>invisible apparition</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a real judge confesses, like Sir E. Hornby, to having seen a ghost, why
      should not a mere accessory after the fact?
    </p>
    <p>
      Regaining my presence of mind, I asked, &lsquo;What brings you here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, to see the fun,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;Fellow being tried for killing me. The
      morbid interest excited round here is very great. Doubt your getting front
      seats.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you manage it for me?&rsquo; I asked imploringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Daresay I can. Here, take my card, and just mention my name, and they&rsquo;ll
      let you in. Case for the prosecution, by the way, <i>most</i> feeble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the appearance, handing me a card, nodded, and vanished in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to Philippa, where I had left her in the four-wheeler. We drove
      off, and found ourselves before a double-swinging (ay, ominous as it
      seemed, <i>swinging</i>) plain oak door, over which in old English letters
      was written&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRIMINAL COURT.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need not describe the aspect of the court. Probably most of my readers
      have at some time in their lives found themselves in such a place.
    </p>
    <p>
      True to the minute, the red-robed Judge appears. It is Sir Joshua Juggins,
      well known for his severity as &lsquo;Gibbeting Juggins.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, there is little hope for William Evans.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have learned from a neighbour in court the evidence against Evans is
      purely circumstantial. He has been found in possession of a peculiar key,
      believed to have belonged to Sir Runan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well may they call the case for the prosecution weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      William must have found that fatal key which Philippa took from the slain
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that accident the whole presumption of his guilt is founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grand Jury (country gentlemen&mdash;idiots all!) find a &lsquo;True Bill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk reads the indictment that &lsquo;he, William Evans, did feloniously,
      wilfully, and of malice aforethought, kill and murder Sir Runan Errand,
      Baronet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the reading goes on Philippa is strangely moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Basil,&rsquo; she whispered, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you see the splendid, unequalled chance for
      an advertisement! I&rsquo;ll get up and make a speech, and say <i>I</i> did it.
      Of course they can&rsquo;t prove it, but it will set every one talking, and
      bring hundreds of pounds into the house every night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I now observed that Philippa had half slipped off her mantle and bonnet.
      Beneath these coverings she was dressed in wig and gown, like Mrs. Weldon
      in the photographs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, Philippa, <i>don&rsquo;t!</i>&rsquo; I whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk turned to William Evans, the prisoner at the Bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you guilty, or not guilty?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence a cigarette-ash might have been heard to drop, if any one
      had been smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long silence was broken, but not by the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      By Philippa!
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising to all her stately height, with her flowing robes around her, she
      stood at bay. Then her clear deep voice rang out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My lord, I was the party that did it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Order in the court! order in the court!&rsquo; cried the ushers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I commit you! I commit you!&rsquo; thundered Lord Justice Juggins. &lsquo;Take her
      away. Five years and hard labour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Struggling violently, Philippa was dragged away by the minions of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      I notice one visitor turn round, and gaze at the commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is Mrs. Thompson, the Bearded Woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence has scarcely been restored, when it is again broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      A manly form rises. A deep voice exclaims:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My lord, the prisoner is innocent. <i>I</i> am the person whom he is said
      to have murdered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The form, the voice&mdash;it is Sir Runan Errand!
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I hear the sharp accents of Mr. Justice Juggins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this court a bear-garden or the House of Commons? Take that man out.
      Give him five years and two dozen lashes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had the court resumed its wonted aspect of business, scarcely had
      the prisoner again been asked to plead, when a shrill voice shattered the
      stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My lord, the key found in the prisoner&rsquo;s possession is my cellar-key.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the bold interrupter was Mrs. Thompson, the Bearded Woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Five years as usual, and hard labour,&rsquo; said Sir Joshua Juggins, wearily.
      He was tiring of his task. &lsquo;Please, my lord, it warn&rsquo;t none of me,&rsquo; came a
      hoarse whisper from the prisoner at the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who asked <i>you</i> to speak? Is that the way to plead?&rsquo; snapped the
      judge. &lsquo;Give him five years also, for contempt of court.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      William Evans was carried out in hysterics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plot, the mystery had thickened.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now felt that there was only one way of fathoming the secret of the
      crime. I also must get myself committed! Then I would be able to rejoin
      the other actors in this strange drama, and learn their motives, and the
      real facts of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment my resolution was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springing to my feet, I exclaimed in clarion tones:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My lord, I am an accessory after the fact.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joshua Juggins gave a cry of despair. Then mastering himself, he
      whispered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take that idiot away, and give him penal servitude for life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As I left the court in chains, I heard the next case being called.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;Cleared Up. (From The &lsquo;Green Park Gazette.&rsquo;)
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE legitimate public interest in the Nownham Mystery suggested to us the
      propriety of sending one of our young men down to interview all parties.
      After having visited the Maori King, Mrs. Weldon, several Eminent
      Advertisers, and the crew of the <i>Mignonette</i>, he felt that his
      present task was a light one. He had to see the murderer, William Evans;
      the murderess, Mrs. South, or Lady Errand; the accessory after the fact,
      Dr. South; the victim, Sir Runan Errand; and Mrs. Thompson, the owner of
      the key on which the case for the prosecution hinged.

      His adventures in the various Asylums where those unhappy persons are
      unconfined have little public interest. We print the Confessions just as
      our young man took them down in shorthand from the lips of the sufferers.

      <i>The Confession of</i> Sir Runan Errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I need not tell you that I never was even the husband of the woman
      Phllippa at all. She stood in no relation to me, except as one of the
      persons in the <i>troupe</i> which I was foolish enough to manage. Instead
      of visiting her in January last to settle her pecuniary claims against me,
      I sent my valet. It appears that the man wore an old hat of mine, which he
      lost in the storm. That was not the only article of property belonging to
      me he carried off. I have since had a penitent letter from him. He is
      doing well in the United States, and has been elected to the Legislature.
      I have given up the freak of dabbling in the show business, and merely
      keep a private theatre at such a distance from human abodes that no one
      can complain of it as a nuisance. Since the disappearance of my valet I
      have been travelling in my own yacht. I reached England the day before the
      trial. &lsquo;No. I never read the newspapers. Thank goodness I am no bookworm.&rsquo;

      <i>The Confession of</i> Philippa South, <i>calling herself</i> Lady
      Errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you again, as I told you before, I know nothing about what I did
      that night. Go back to your employers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more of a nature suited to our columns could be extracted from
      this lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Confession of</i> Mrs. Thompson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I lost my cellar key the night Philippa left my roof. I now recognise it
      as the key in the possession of William Evans. How he got it I have no
      idea whatever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Confession of</i> Basil South, M.D.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I begin to understand it all at last. The key which I took from Philippa
      on the night of the storm and supposed murder had not been taken by her
      from Sir Runan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She had brought it with her from the house of Mrs. Thompson, with whom
      she had been residing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I threw away a key, which I believed to be the one I had taken from
      Philippa, I made a mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I threw away a key of my own. When I thought I was giving William Evans
      the key of my cellar (with fatal intentions and designs, hoping that he
      would never survive the contents of that cellar), I really gave him the
      key I had taken from Philippa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Consequently the key would not fit the cellar lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Consequently William Evans never tasted the fatal fluid, and so escaped
      his doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have nothing to add to this confession, except that I am deeply
      penitent, and will never again offer a thoughtless public a Christmas
      Annual so absurd, morbid, and incoherent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This last statement made it unnecessary to interview William Evans.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the other persons in this dismal affair are detained during her
      Majesty&rsquo;s displeasure.
